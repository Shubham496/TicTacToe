# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. The game allows two players to take turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (player vs player)
- Random placement of player marks (X and O)
- Displays a 3x3 grid to visualize the game board
- Allows players to make moves until there is a winner or the game ends in a tie

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (No additional libraries are required)

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Run the game using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python3 tictactoe.py
   ```

4. The game will prompt you to enter a number (1-9) to make a move. The number corresponds to the positions on the board as shown below:

   ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   ---------
   4 | 5 | 6
   ---------
   7 | 8 | 9
   ```

5. Players will alternate between 'X' and 'O'. The game ends when there is a winner or a tie.

## Game Board

The board is represented by a 3x3 grid, and players take turns marking a spot. Hereâ€™s an example of how the board looks during the game:

```
X | O | X
---------
O | X | 6
---------
7 | 8 | O
```

The numbers indicate available spaces, and 'X' or 'O' marks indicate where each player has made a move.

## Code Structure

- `tictactoe.py`: The main file that contains the game logic, including the functions for displaying the board, checking for a winner, and handling player input.
- `functions.py`: Contains helper functions used for making moves and checking the game status.

## How It Works

1. **Main loop:** The game runs in a `while` loop, prompting the players to input their moves until the game ends (either a player wins or the board is full).
2. **Grid display:** The grid is displayed using a `for` loop, and the player's move is placed at the corresponding grid position.
3. **Win check:** After each move, the program checks if there is a winner using a series of `if-else` conditions to check for horizontal, vertical, or diagonal alignment of marks.
4. **Randomness:** The first player is chosen randomly at the start of the game.
